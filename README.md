# Welcome to my Fullstack Portfolio!
##### As a budding fullstack developer, I am eager to showcase my skills and demonstrate my passion for programming through my personal portfolio.

##### This portfolio is a collection of my fullstack projects that demonstrate my ability to create web applications that are interactive, responsive, and intuitive. Through these projects, I aim to provide visitors with a glimpse into my programming capabilities and the types of solutions I can build.

##### My personal portfolio is a showcase of my skills as a full-stack developer. I have used a variety of technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Mocha, Node.js, C#, SQL, and Redux to build different types of projects. These projects range from simple front-end applications to complex full-stack web applications that interact with external APIs, such as Spotify, OMDb, and Reddit. I have also utilized Git and GitHub for version control and collaborative development. By exploring my portfolio, you can get a better understanding of my abilities and the technologies I have experience with.

##### I am excited to share my work with the world and to continue growing as a fullstack developer. Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio, and please don't hesitate to reach out to [](mailto:dragos.pascariu@proton.me) if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.
