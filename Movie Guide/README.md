# Movie Guide


This is a single-page application that allows users to search for movies or TV shows using the OMDb API. The app provides detailed information about the movie/TV show, including its rating, poster, genre, runtime, cast, and plot description. The UI of the app is designed to resemble the IMDB website, making it easy for users to navigate and find what they're looking for.
